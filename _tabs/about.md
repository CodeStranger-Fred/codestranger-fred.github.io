## 💡 Quick Story

With a Bachelor's in **Financial Statistics** from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, I started in the world of data and machine learning 📊🤖. But I soon realized I wanted to **build impactful systems**, not just analyze them. So I pivoted into Computer Science—a decision that thrilled my family (especially when I could explain cloud computing at the dinner table 😄).

Today, I’ve immersed myself in everything from backend systems to scalable cloud-native applications, embracing the chaos and creativity of full-stack development.
